        <p> The first half of the class will be <em>technically</em> focused. It will be comprised of a series of lessons, readings, workshops, and small projects to develop familiarity and confidence with the language of the web. <em>We will focus on the basic languages of web <small>development:</small> HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript.</em> <br><br>This class is designed for students with no programming experience at all, <strong>but should be useful to any skill level.</strong> The second half will be focused on a larger project website.</p>
