    <h1><u>My Photography Journey</u></h1>
    <h2><em>How it all began....</em></h2>

    
    <p>When I first started photography, I was in high school. It wasn't until recenlty that I came to love photography. A couple years ago, I bought my first camera. <br><br>It was a Canon T7. This was only the beginning of what was to come. <br><br> After I got my camera, I went on Youtube to try and learn everything I could. I knew that over time I would get better, and long story short I did.</p>

    <p>I started off taking pictures of nature; mainly plants, trees, grass, etc. Then I started taking pictures of actual people. <br><br> This spawned into my love for portrait photography. I have been blessed enough to have taken picuters of my family, my sister graduating college, done soem fashion photoragphy, and my coolest one yet...an engagement shoot!<br><br> Never did I think I would see myself doing engagement shoots or anything of that nature. It was a dream come true. Who knows what the future holds. Maybe I'll be a wedding photographer...</p>
